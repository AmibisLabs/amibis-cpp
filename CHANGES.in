In this files, you will find changes between OMiSCID versions.

%Version%    %Date%
    [Global modifications]
    - change stuff in order to be actually able to install several
      instances of Omiscid on the same computer.
    - add automatic test processing (compilation with many combination
      of parameters). As Avahi is not stable for our test suite (see
      [Known features]), failed test using avahi are not considered as
      relevant.
    [API]
    - change API in Service and ServiceProxy class. Now you have the
      same API to get the PeerIf for both classes: GetPeerId() in order
      to get numerical value of the peerId and GetPeerIdAsString() to get
      a SimpleString containing its string representation.
    - add 2 static member methods to ComTools: PeerIdFromString and
      PeerIdAsString to handle peerId transformation.
    - change java callback paradigm for local variable listeners to
      be compliant with the C++ version (do not affect your C++ code).
    [Known features]
    - still crash (segmentation fault, corrupted double chained list in
      glibc, problem in D-BUS) when using Avahi to (un)register many
      services in the same process (even with Avahi 0.6.19). No longer
      trying to cope with this features. Let's Avahi team solve this.
    - Avahi and mDns can now collaborate on the same computer. mDns
      works fine and Avahi do not work worst.
    - You can have up to 9 DnsSD daemon at the same time (sic...).
      Be carrefull, when using hibernate functionnality under linux,
      some time the DnsSd daemon can generate at each wake up a false
      new instance and a new daemon number. If this number goes
      over 9, you may encounter problems.

1.1.1    2007-04-28
    [Global modifications]
    - add some specific changes for gcc problematic version under
      gentoo (it do not see that a variable will be initialised
      in all path of the function, so add initialisation).

1.1.0    2007-04-27
    [Global modifications]
    - change this file grouping changes by section.
    - add Avahi support for DNS-SD (with Avahi 0.6.17)
    - Default choice is still mDNS under Linux/MacOSX (see known
      features to understand why). Add an option for scons to
      override this automatic choice. (zeroconf=Avahi)
    - enable automatically DnsSdProxy when using ServiceControl
      Layer (due to Avahi limitation)
    - internal refactoring dues to Avahi stuff (sic...). No
      changes in exposed API.
    - Change examples codes, add new one.
    [API modification]
    - change Thread constructor behaviour because of virtualisation
      problem with gcc. You can not anymore create an autostart
      Thread. You must start it in you inherited class as shown
      previously in 'Examples/RegisterSearchTest.cpp'.
    - check init constraints to static global values, so replace
      global values like DynamicNameSolving by a method call
      like GetDynamicNameSolving().
    - add SharedMemSegment class in the System layer in order to
      propose multiplateform shared memory management
    - add UserFriendly API in order to provide browsing fonctionnality
      ServiceRepository and ServiceRepositoryBrowser. Add an example
      showing this functionality : BrowsingTest.cpp.
    [Bug corrections]
    - Change Event::Wait() bug when asking for subsecond timers
        under Linux/OSX
    - correct huge data send problem when sending to all clients
    - some other minor bug corrections
    [Known features]
    - Crash (segmentation fault, corrupted double chained list in glibc,
      problem in D-BUS) when using Avahi to (un)register many services
      in the same process. Still trying to cope with this feature but
      it seems to be internal to Avahi.
    - Avahi and mDns do not like to collaborate on the same computer.
      Even if in this version OMiSCID can handle service with multiple
      local DNS-SD daemons, try to avoid this feature mixing both on
      the same computer. Running Avahi and mDNS on separate computer
      seems to word fine.

1.0.5    2007-02-01
    - correct some portability problem with Mac OSX
    - change tabs into 4 spaces
    - minor corrections

1.0.4    2007-01-09
    - correct some dead lock problems
    - correct send huge TCP messages under linux (worked fine
      under windows).
    - correct some bugs

1.0.3    2006-10-26
    - Add a global include file for the User Friendly Interface
      and change examples to use this include. The new include
      file can be use with this statement:
        #include <ServiceControl/UserFriendlyAPI.h>
    - change all "Attribut" (in French) to "Attribute" in English
      either in file, function or class names
    - correct a little memory leak problem (problem in reference
      count) when using SubString.

1.0.2   2006-10-02
    - Change to be compliant with Bonjour version 107.6 (changes
      made by Apple in API, 2006-09-18) and at the same time with
      previous versions.

1.0.1
    - Add missing folder ServiceControl

1.0.0
    - Initial version

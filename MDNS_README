[Linux]
You can download the version 214.3.2 from
http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/
(warning, archives are in *alphabetic* order).
Just run the folowing commands in the untar files :
* cd mDNSPosix
* make install os=linux

On some Linux platforms (like Ubuntu), you may
need to modify the Makefile in the mDNSPosix folder
(because of specific gcc flags on these version of
Linux). You must add '-fno-stack-protector' to
the CFLAGS in order to compile. After that,
previous commands remain valid.

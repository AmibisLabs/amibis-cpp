In this files, you will find changes between OMiSCID versions.

1.1.0	2007-XX-XX
	[Global modifications]
	- change this file grouping changes by section.
	- add Avahi support for DNS-SD (with Avahi 0.6.17)
	- Default choice is still mDNS under Linux/MacOSX (see known
	  features to understand why). Add an option for scons to
	  override this automatic choice.
	- enable automatically DnsSdProxy when using ServiceControl
	  Layer (due to Avahi limitation)
	- internal refactoring dues to Avahi stuff (sic...). No
	  changes in exposed API.
	[API modification]
	- change Thread constructor behaviour because of virtualisation
	  problem with gcc. You can not anymore create an autostart
	  Thread. You must start it in you inherited class as shown
	  previously in 'Examples/RegisterSearchTest.cpp'.
	- check init constraints to static global values, so replace
	  global values like DynamicNameSolving by a method call
	  like GetDynamicNameSolving().
	- add SharedMemSegment class in the System layer in order to
	  propose multiplateform shared memory management
	[Bug corrections]
	- Change Event::Wait() bug when asking for subsecond timers
		under Linux/OSX
	- correct huge data send problem when sending to all clients
	- some other minor bug corrections
	[Known features]
	- Crash (segmentation fault, corrupted double chained list in glibc,
	  problem in D-BUS) when using Avahi and unregistering many services
	  in the same process. Still trying to cope with this feature.
